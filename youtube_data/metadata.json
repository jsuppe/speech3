      "transcript": "Several years ago, our daughter had a profound experience on her mission. With her approval, I share an excerpt of what she wrote to us that week. Yesterday, a returning member asked us to come over as soon as possible. When we arrived, we found her on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Through the tears, we found out that she had lost her job, was going to be evicted from her apartment, and once again become homeless. Our daughter continued, while we cried together, until she was ready to stand up and face this trial. After this woman was comforted, our daughter then used the scriptures to try and help her understand the reality of her divine worth and to teach her one of the most fundamental truths of our existence, that we are beloved sons and daughters of God, a God that feels perfect compassion for us when we suffer and is ready to assist us. As we stand back up, it is insightful that the first point of doctrine that our missionaries teach is that God is our loving Heavenly Father. Every subsequent truth builds on the foundational understanding of who we really are. Susan H. Porter, primary general president, taught, when you know and understand how completely you are loved as a child of God, it changes everything. It changes the way you feel about yourself. When you make mistakes, it changes how you feel when difficult things happen. It changes your view of God's commandments. It changes your view of others and of your capacity to make a difference. This change is illustrated as we read about the experience Moses had when talking with God face to face. During that conversation, God repeatedly taught Moses of his divine heritage, saying, Moses, thou art my son. God explained that Moses was in the similitude of his only begotten. Moses came to understand clearly who he was, that he had a work to do, and that he had a loving Heavenly Father. After this experience, the adversary came tempting him and immediately addressed him by saying, Moses, son of man. This is a common and dangerous tool in the arsenal of the adversary.",

It's going to be a game changer if you're a facilitator or run any type of collaborative sessions with groups. What you're going to see next is a video from our course called Workshopper Master, which is basically a program that teaches people how to become master level facilitators. And this is going to be one of the six laws of master levels facilitation. And these are often the things that people who learn facilitation don't think about. So these are sort of uncommon or counterintuitive things that people often just forget about. And it sort of makes their workshops less interesting. Okay, I don't want to waste any more time. I want you to be a better facilitator eight minutes from now. Let's go. Law number three, start strong and stronger. This is one of the easiest laws to implement, but also the law that 90% of workshoppers forget. This law relies on two phenomena of the human brain. One is called the serial position effect. And the serial position effect basically means that people tend to remember the first few things and the last few things in a series. This can be numbers, this can be events, this can be a whole day at Disneyland. They generally remember the start and the end more than anything else. That's the first phenomena. And the second phenomena is called the peak end rule. And the peak end rule basically says that people don't remember an experience based on all of the individual moments of an experience. So for example, they won't remember the workshop because of all the individual moments. They'll remember one peak, meaning one high point, and they'll remember the end and pretty much nothing else. Two of these things combined mean that if you get the start right, and if you get the end right, you've basically covered 80% of the things that people are actually going to remember about your workshop. And this is why at AJNsmart, we try to make sure our workshops start strong, start memorably, and they end strong, because they're going to forget everything in the middle anyway. And really the start and the end are the way you can really build in powerful moments that people go away with and think about forever. So to repeat, start strong, end stronger, this literally means the ending is the most important thing. The start is of course important, but even if you manage to mess that up, you need to stick the ending. People will leave feeling like it was the most amazing thing they've ever been part of, if you can get the end right. What happens if you ignore this law? Well people are still going to remember the start, one peak, and the end. And if these were nothing special, then the workshop will feel like nothing special. Will feel like it just passed like a blur. And even if you got stuff done, and even if it was really interesting, and even if you actually achieved something, it's still going to be a blur. And even if you got stuff done, and even if it was really interesting, and even if you actually achieved something, it's still going to be a blur.",

I am here today at the gracious invitation of President Price and the Duke Board of Trustees because after spending four years at what is considered one of the finest institutions of higher education in the world, they apparently feel that perhaps some light entertainment will get you all to the final realization. You know, I think I've really had enough of this place. Let's bring in a comedian. Let's bring the sophistication and erudition of the Duke experience down a couple notches. And I thought maybe that does make sense. Maybe the thinking was what we really want is to just get these kids the hell out of here. What would give them that last final push? Because what you might not be fully aware of is that the entire time you have been at this wonderful university, we have been meeting and talking to other kids that we would like to replace you with. Not because we weren't happy with you. Not at all. You have been great. It's just, you know, we wanted to see what's out there. I don't want to say exactly how many kids we talked to. It's roughly this many. And we met a lot of wonderful kids. A lot. Was there a time when we were thrilled to have you come here to learn, grow and flourish? Of course there was. That time has passed. We do offer graduate programs in a number of different disciplines if you and your parents want to stall your ultimate uselessness for a few more years. I can't imagine how sick you are of hearing about following your passion. I say the hell with passion. Find something you can do. That would be great. If you try something and it doesn't work, that's okay too. Most things do not work. Most things are not good. You know this already from your short lives. You leave the house. You come back. How was pieing hard? Eh, it was okay. That's why everyone tries so hard to get in here. Duke actually is really good. The school is the square handicap button that opens the broadhead doors to your life. Unless it's those heavy wooden doors at the West Union. Those will kill you. Let go of this idea that you have to find this one great thing that is my passion, my great passion with your shirt torn open and your heat.",

      "transcript": "Hey guys, in today's video we'll be discussing what to do after you've decided that you want to go ahead and host your first workshop. If you haven't met me yet, my name is Petra, I am the founder of CoLab Events, I'm an event manager, business strategist and I specialize in teaching entrepreneurs, businesses and influencers how to host successful and profitable events. If you enjoyed this video, please give it a like and if you want to learn more about hosting your own strategic event, consider subscribing. Okay, let's say that you've committed, you've decided you want to go ahead and host your first workshop. The natural next question for many is where do I start? The first thing I do when I work with my clients is to get really clear on the destination or you can call it your event goal. I find that 99% of all events overall purpose is looking at the big picture and to serve and provide some sort of value. There's so many ways of serving, it can be educational, inspirational, entertaining and so on. But the important part here is understanding when we come from a place of serving, we'll generally do better. We do better because we take away the pressure of achieving a specific result. We tend not to attach too much meaning to the actual outcome and if we could serve one person then that is a success. In saying that, we still need to set a destination because for example, if you jump in your car and you don't decide on a final destination, you're going to have to set a destination. So, if you're going to set a destination, you'll most likely just drive around aimlessly and waste a lot of petrol and probably end up pretty frustrated. However, if you set your destination to be the beach, then it's easier to work out how to get there. So, my first question to you is what is it that you want to get out of this workshop? And please be specific here. For example, I want to use my workshop as a funnel leading people into working one-on-one with me. Now, after you've hosted your event, you can go back to this goal and say, did I achieve this? But was it specific enough? Would you be happy if only one person signed up or do you have a specific number in mind? So, we can be even more specific here. I would like to convert 15% of my event attendees into one-on-one clients. To give you a rough idea, industry average when it comes to conversion rates is between 20 and 30%. But I think here it's important to go back and just remind you that although we set these targets, it's still important not to attach meaning to it. If you convert 5%, it doesn't mean that you're not doing a good job or that you have no idea what you're doing. However, it will leave clues and lessons that you can learn from to get closer to your goals next time. If you need to pause this video now to have a little think and start writing down your goals, please do so. As my mentor says, don't just go through emotions. It's easy to get stuck in watching videos and then not actually taking actions. Stop now and do the work. The next question I would like...",

      "transcript": "Big-name consulting firms like McKinsey, Bain, and BCG all do one thing really well. They create amazing presentations for their clients. But it's not just the formatting and design that makes these presentations so special. It's the story they tell. In this video, I'm going to teach you how to take your presentation and turn it into a story with clear takeaways, compelling insights, and an engaging narrative. I'll walk through each step of the storytelling process in detail and show you a couple examples of what this looks like in the real world. All that and more, coming up. Hi everyone, my name is Paul and I'm an instructor at The Analyst Academy. We provide advanced PowerPoint presentation design and data visualization training to consulting, strategy, and finance teams. So if that sounds like something you're interested in, make sure you visit us at theanalystacademy.com. When building a presentation, regardless of who the audience is, you have one primary goal. To make it as easy as possible for the audience to understand what you're trying to tell them. And this can be difficult. Business presentations tend to have a lot of data and information, and it can be hard for the audience to understand what you're trying to tell them. And it can be hard for the audience to grasp the key insights right away, especially if they're trying to also listen to the speaker and think about what they're going to say in response. So when building your deck, it's especially important to make sure it's structured in a way that makes it clear, insightful, and engaging. It's something top consulting firms do really well, thanks in part to two important concepts, the SCQA framework and the pyramid principle. In simple terms, SCQA is just a framework for presentations that allows you to craft a story around the information you're trying to present. It stands for situation, complication. Question and answer. Every presentation is an answer to some question such as, should we acquire this company? Or how did this marketing campaign perform? Or even what did you find in your research? And the SCQA framework just allows you to provide context for that answer. Practically speaking, this means that your main deck is used to show your answer and the situation, complication, and question are how you provide context for that answer. Let's consider an example. Let's say you're on a consulting case for Disney. The executives have asked you to make a recommendation. For where they should build their next theme park. The main part of your presentation will be the actual recommendation and all the supporting details, but then the situation, complication, and question will form your introduction slide. The situation is how things are right now. The complication represents a change in that situation and is the reason why the presentation is needed. The question is what gets raised by the complication and what needs to be solved. Then the answer is the resolution. So here, the situation might be something like Disney's looking to grow revenue, or they're looking to grow revenue by opening a new park. The complication could be, they need to decide where to open this park, which then leads to the implicit question, which is where should Disney open its next theme park? Then the main part of your deck answers this question. And notice how this brings the presentation to life. It puts the presentation in context and it tells the audience why they should care. Instead of just dropping them in the middle of your data, you're leading them along and creating a narrative. Remember your goal is to make it as easy.",

Like, you're not 100% sure what could happen if you keep going. You can do it. Tomorrow is going to be better. What do you tell people when they ask you, you know, how can I present like you? How can I get better? The thing that really, really helps is I've learned about the perspective, to change my perspective. So, for example, I show up to give. And I always remind people that the most important thing about being an effective presenter, an effective speaker, is you have to show up with a giving attitude. You have to show up to give. You know something, you've seen something, you've done something, you've tried something, that someone else thinks others need to hear. That's why they invited you to speak. The problem is the number of people who show up to take, to get. And you can see. It's very plain to see. People ask a question and they say, you'll have to buy my book. Or you could just tell me the answer because you know the answer because you wrote the book. Right. But clearly they're trying to drive book sales. It's a taking mentality. Every single slide of their PowerPoint has their Instagram, their email, their website, their Facebook. Well, clearly they want you to follow them. They want you to reach out. The last slide is their website and their email. Right. They have a taking mentality. They come up and the first thing they do is tell you their credentials. Hi. My name is Eric. name is you know dr. blah-dee-blah I have six PhDs I've worked for 55 companies I advise CEOs and generals and let me tell you a little something it's about them it's very easy and very quick to discern who's the giver and who's the taker the best speakers a hundred percent of them you look at all the top ten folks you know sir Ken Robinson Amy Cuddy Brene Brown right Dan Pink all of them all of them are there to give none of them want anything from anybody not even your approval nobody's I don't know any great speaker that stands in the backstage that goes I'm gonna get a standing ovation you may get one if you earn it if they decide that what you have given them is a value that's not the reason you show up you show up to give how many guys experience fear when you speak how many of you by show of hands know that public speaking is fundamental to your industry your career by show of hands how many of you by show of hands honestly speaking experience a little bit of fear when we talk about public speaking raise your hand and over the last three years I've had the opportunity to travel the country and deliver presentations like this then what I've picked up on is that there are certain patterns there are certain patterns and certain skill sets that if applied can make a public speaker",

      "transcript": "Well, no doubt many of you are wondering why the Speaker is so old. Well, the answer is obvious. He hasn't died yet. And why was the Speaker chosen? Well, I don't know that either. I like to think that the Development Department had nothing to do with it. Whatever the reason, I think it's very fitting that I'm sitting here because I see one crowd of faces in the rear not wearing robes, and I know from having educated an army of descendants who really deserves a lot of the honors that are being given to the people up here in front. The sacrifice and the wisdom and the value transfer that comes from one generation to the next can never be underrated. And that gave me enormous pleasure as I looked at this sea of Asian faces to my left. All my life I've admired Confucius. I like the idea of Felix. The idea of the old piety. The idea that there are values that are taught and duties that come naturally and that all that should be passed on to the next generation. And you people who don't think there's anything in this idea, please note how fast these Asian faces are rising in American life. I think they have something. All right, I scratched out a few notes, and I'm going to try and just give an example. I'm going to give an account of some ideas and attitudes that have worked well for me. I don't claim that they're perfect for everybody, although I think many of them are pretty close to universal values, and many of them are can't-fail ideas. What are the core ideas that have helped me? Well, luckily, I got at a very early age the idea that the safest way to try and get what you want is to try and disappear. You deserve what you want. It's such a simple idea. It's the golden rule, so to speak. You want to deliver to the world what you would buy if you were on the other end. There is no ethos, in my opinion, that is better for any lawyer or any other person to have. By and large, the people who've had this ethos win in life, and they don't win just money, just honors and emoluments. They win the respect. The deserved trust. The trust of the people they deal with. And there is huge pleasure in life to be obtained from getting deserved trust.",

      "transcript": "Hi, I'm Michael and today I'm going to talk about how to give really effective sales presentation that lead to revenue. So not just talking, everybody feeling good, but real money. How do you do it? The most important part to remember is that you always have a curve in the attention span. People will remember the first few seconds, the first minutes let's say, as really critical and then their attention span will go down and then it will go back up at the end. So what do you do? You put your most valuable content in the beginning. If that is a demo, if you know that they will buy when you show the demo, you show that demo in the beginning, not in here. So what do most companies do? They start by saying, hi, we're this company, I'm this guy, I'm really important, I've done blah blah blah blah blah blah, that means you're already here, so you've wasted your best part. Then they start showing the team, they start showing features, this is all the things we do, that is not as it should be. What you do is, you come in, you say, hi, I'm Michael, because they need to know who you are and you need to know who is sitting around the room, so you ask, let's do a little tour so you know who is important or not. Then what you say is, you say, let me tell you a story. Just saying the word, I'm going to tell a story, makes people pay attention. You say, let me tell you a story of another client I have visited last week. And you tell the problem, actually, you tell their problem with the story of another client. That is how you start. I tell you, they are going to pay very, very good attention, because they know, this is about me, this is going to solve my problem. And then you're going to say, okay, that is why we have started our company. And then you go here, you start explaining how you deal with things, what are the features of your product, and then you go back to the end, where you're going to close the loop to solve the problem you've talked here in the beginning. And then you end really strong by saying sentences like, I am confident my solution will bring you X or Y value. Always end really, really strong. Don't say, hey, this is the end of my presentation. Don't say, this is the last slide. I'm happy you didn't fall asleep. That kind of stuff. Just never do that again. So a really good trick is when you get to the end, you actually show a slide with the two next actions, always one or two, A, B, people want to choose. And then you pause dramatically, you count to three in your head, and then you say, I am confident this solution will bring you that value. Any questions? That trick always works. So remember, guys, the most important point in the beginning and a very strong end. And whatever happens here, nobody will remember, right? I hope you enjoyed the show. If you like it, give it a thumbs up. Or subscribe for a lot more information.",

I seldom use visuals, but I can't resist sharing this one. This cri de coeur comes from my eight-year-old friend Marin Arnold, written when she was seven. I will translate for you her early Reformed Egyptian. Dear Bishop, General Conference was boring. Why do we have to do it? Tell me why. Sincerely, Marin Arnold. Well, Marin, the talk I'm about to give will undoubtedly disappoint you again. But when you write your bishop to complain, it's important that you tell him, My name is Kieran. Elder Patrick Kieran. For nearly two years, a pandemic of biblical proportions has enveloped our planet. And while that plague brought a halt to almost everything socially, obviously it did not bring a halt to brutality, violence, and cruel aggression politically, nationally, or internationally. As if that were not enough, we're still facing long-standing social and cultural challenges, ranging from economic deprivation to environmental desecration to racial inequity and more. Such winds and dark days can be discouraging to the youth among us, those to whom we look for optimism and enthusiasm regarding the tomorrows of our lives. It's been said that the power of youths, youths, youths, youths, is the commonwealth for the entire world. The young are the faces of our future. Furthermore, our children are the trustees into whose hands the destiny of this Church will one day be placed. Given our current times, it's understandable if the idealism of the young is waning a little. Dr. Laurie Santos, a professor at Yale University, recently created a class for the youth, which is called the Youth of the World. The Youth of the World is a class for the youth, which is called the Youth of the World. The Youth of the World is a class for the youth, which is called the Youth of the World.",

This is what you told me. I'm going to teach you the top eight ways in your book to more effectively deliver a business presentation so that you can get your audience to do what you want, so you can motivate them, show credibility, and even make more money. And I'm going to start with how to make boring topics interesting. You should know I'm going to model everything I suggest you do. It used to drive me crazy when I'd go to these conferences and people would tell me to do stuff, but they either wouldn't tell me exactly how to do it or they wouldn't show me how to do it themselves. Everything I'm going to suggest you do, including what I just did, which is called the circle of knowledge, by the way, and I'll give you the steps to it later, I'm going to model for you. And I'm going to start with these fish right here. This is called a hook. And as you know, in fishing, if you don't make the hook appealing, they don't want it. You've got to do the same thing with your presentation. And the number one way that adults find hooks appealing is if you tell them why you're going to give it to them. Most people start with what? Exactly, they start with the what you're going to get. It doesn't work. Do you remember the first thing I said to you? Hi, I'm Jason Tiedek. I gave you my credentials. But then I said, I'm going to show you how to gain a competitive advantage by delivering an irresistible presentation that gets your audience to do what you want. You didn't know how I was going to do it yet. You didn't know how I was going to do it yet. You didn't know what it was going to look like yet. But you knew why you wanted it. I was in line to buy an iPad a few years ago for my wife. And a man and I were talking in this line, because it's about 100 people long. This is when they first came out. And I looked at him and I said, I see you're in line to buy an iPad. And he says, yep. I said, what does it do? He goes, I don't know. I've never seen one. You've never seen one? He goes, nope. I said, well, then how do you know you want it? Because it's going to change my life, he says to me. This is how he says it. It's going to change my life. Really? Really. Why is it going to change your life? He goes, because Steve Jobs, I watched him present on this. And he explained to me that it's going to save me time. I'm going to get things done finally. And I'm going to be able to have some fun, too, because I get really bored during the day. He's telling me all these things. I'm like, wow, everything he's telling me is which one? Why he'd want it. Here's the practical. I want you to, for your next presentation, to take all the topics you're going to teach. And next to each one, I want you to write down, whether or not you're going to be able to do it. Whether you think it'll make your audience more successful, more happy, or have more freedom in their life. Just write an H, S, or F next to each topic. Then write down why. And then look at all those summaries of those topics. And then summarize all that in one sentence. Like, I'm going to show you how to gain a competitive advantage by delivering a presentation that gets your audience.",

      "transcript": "United States. Welcome to this Hillsdale College online course called Constitution 101. By Constitution, we of course mean the greatest and longest living of all the constitutions in history, the Constitution of the United States. We study that here because we're mindful of the fact, always have been at Hillsdale, that we are citizens and we need our freedom in order to live well and do our work, especially the work of a college, which radically depends upon freedom of every kind. We teach the Constitution to every student here at the college and now we're going to help you learn something about it. The other people who are teaching in this are members of our politics faculty. I'm a member of that faculty myself. And among them all, they may have the most knowledge of the meaning of the Constitution and the significance of the changes that have gone on around it. And so it should be a privilege for you to watch this and I hope you enjoy it. And I hope you read and continue learning about this for as long as you live and teach others too. So much I'll explain depends on that. There are a lot of details in this course. Details of how exactly things work and why they work. Details of different understandings than the one that prevails here about those things. And so that will involve us in some complications. And it'll be helpful, I think, if we can do that. And I hope you enjoy it. And keep the kind of general points in mind. And I'm going to name some of those today in my lecture. My first question I'll ask myself and you is, what kind of thing are the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution? Turns out the answer to that is very enriching. They're different documents. There's an argument that they're opposed. There's a powerful argument in the historical scholarship that the Declaration was meant to be a radical, document, and the Constitution was meant to be conservative. And those people argue that the Declaration is about the rights of us all, and the Constitution is really about protecting the privileged. Well, we think that's nonsense around here, and even on its face, it's nonsense. For one reason, at the time, exact time, the Declaration of Independence is from 1776, and the Constitution is from 1776.",

We thank you for your participation and for your faith. Today, I will speak on what I have learned about the miracle of finding personal peace, whatever our circumstances. The Savior knows that all of Heavenly Father's children yearn for peace, and He said that He could give it to us. You remember the words of Jesus Christ recorded in the book of John, Peace I leave with you. My peace I give. I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. What He means by peace and how He can give it are revealed by the circumstances of those who heard Him speak those words. Listen to the account in John of the culmination of Christ's ministry. Fierce forces of evil were bearing down on Him and would soon come upon His disciples. Here are the Savior's words. If ye love me, keep my commandments, and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever. Amen. Even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth Him not, neither knoweth Him, but ye know Him. For He dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more, \u00fb Thank you.",

You got a long journey ahead of you because you're going to find out that while your dad did a lot of s**t to you, you're going to have to make it on your own. Because this world we live in is tough. It's tough. It will beat you down. The world and the life that we live in is the ultimate competitor. The world's tough. The world's tough. It will try to take you out. It will find your weakness and it will just hammer you. So, it's time to get back to work. Get back to work. Stop hearing yourself talk. Get off the podcast. Don't be on social media too much. Cut out all the f**king noise. Get back to the f**king mental lab. Because that's where the knowledge came from. You need to get to a point in your life where there's nothing that can hurt you because you know exactly who you are. You've faced your demons. You were able to hear all your past traumas. You were able to listen to them. You were able to f**king say, okay, now I can, now talk to people about what I went through. I'm no longer embarrassed. I'm no longer ashamed. Being ashamed is one of the biggest things that kill people nowadays. In their minds. Kill them from moving forward. I'm ashamed of myself. Don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life. Face it. Fix it. Make it better. Everything I need is in my mental lab. Everything. Because I'm in constant study of myself. And I know what needs to be conquered because I'm constantly going through what I don't like. What I'm not comfortable with. I know. And only I can fix these problems. Because I have to face these problems. Unchosen suffering is going to happen, right? So the only thing that you can do is have some chosen suffering to prepare for it. It's the only thing you can do. That's the only thing you can practice for the unchosen suffering is have chosen suffering. Do something that sucks every day. I'm not trying to send a message of run 200 miles. Be the baddest motherf**ker in the world. But be tough. You better have a part about you that's tough. A part about you that can break down situations and get better. And break down situations very quickly within some trauma in your life. Some devastation in your life. Because it's going to come. The devastation, the trauma is going to come. And you can't allow that to become a jersey barrier. It can't be a jersey barrier. It has to be something that you can maneuver through very quickly and move forward. That takes a lot of toughness. A lot of people, when you die, they figure out why you died. They figure out how you died. It's been the autopsy. But we never do a live autopsy to figure out why we're dying while we are alive. And I was dying. I was living every day. But I was really dead. And so I figured it out. And once I figured it out, I was able to...",

      "transcript": "In the 1860s and 70s, one of the most popular people in the United States wasn't even an American. He was a Frenchman, whose name was Jean-Francois Gu\u00e9valet. But he was better known by his stage name, the Great Blondin. And what made Blondin great? Blondin was an acrobat and a tightrope walker. And he did something that no one had ever done before. He went to Niagara Falls, a beautiful and dangerous place, and he threw a two-inch-wide tightrope across the falls and walked across it safely with 25,000 people in attendance. Over the course of years, Blondin would come back to Niagara Falls, and he would do something more daring every time. The next time, he might be blindfolded. The time after that, he literally sat down in the middle of his crossing, and made himself an omelet. Another time, he took a camera and took a photograph of the persons on the other side of the falls. Every time, something more daring, something more unique, something creative and astounding. And his fame grew and grew and grew. And then after one particular crossing, with an assembled crowd there screaming his name, chanting his name, he calmed the crowd, and he said, I'm going to do something more daring than I've ever done before. Do you believe that I can do it? And they yelled back, We believe! We believe! And then, he said, I'm going to take someone on my back, and I'm going to cross the falls safely. Do you believe that I can do it? And they all screamed, We believe! We believe! And when they said, we believe, Gravelet looked at them, the great Blondin looked at them and smiled. And he said, Which one of you will be that person? Which one of you will be that person? Which one of you will be that person? And there was silence. And so finally, one person did come forward. It was actually his manager. And that moved Blondin very deeply. But Blondin did take him on his back. And they did cross the falls safely. I've been fascinated with this story since the day that I first read it. Fascinated with it.",

      "transcript": "Welcome everyone. Today I want to share with you my approach to crafting a stellar academic presentation. A presentation that's not only going to persuade your audience but it's going to leave a lasting impression on them that's going to knock their socks off. I'm Professor David Stuckler. I've given over 50 keynotes at international conferences and hundreds of other presentations. I used to tremble with nervousness trying to speak clearly with confidence. Even doing this program today would have been a struggle for me. But by following these simple steps in the presentation not only could I present with ease and confidence but I could really craft an effective lecture that was going to give me results and get me invited again and again to conferences and keynotes. So to start one thing that you need to know when you present you first have to open the gates for people to be able to hear what you have to say. And here I draw on Aristotle's model of persuasion. There are really three elements that you need for an effective talk. You need the logos, the ethos, and the pathos. Now by each of these what we mean the logos we mean more the intellectual side the content of your talk what you're trying to deliver. And so many people just start with that but until people are ready until you've opened their hearts and their minds they they're not going to be ready to listen to you. It's like planting the soil right if you just throw a seed in the ground it's not going to grow into a plant. You need to till the soil you need to start preparing it so that seed can grab hold and grow. And that's exactly what you need to do. So before you get to that logos part of your talk we need to do two things. We need to open them up emotionally with pathos and then with ethos we need to convince them that you're the right person to deliver this message. So what you need to do is really the following. The pathos you need to reach them emotionally. You need to connect with them. You need to connect with them emotionally. You need to connect with them on a very human level and that can be about why you're having this conversation now. Why is what you're about to talk about so important and try to connect on an emotional level. Immediately after doing that you need to connect with them with the ethos. Why you're the right person. Why you're qualified. Why do you have the profile to have this conversation with them about the topic you want to present to them. And only when you have hit both the pathos and the ethos are you in the right place to communicate the logos which is really the scientific meat. Of the talk that you want to give. So let me run through this model very briefly and how I suggest starting your talk and making sure you hit all three of these major points to communicate your message effectively. So when I was learning to present at Oxford University I remember being so nervous about a talk when one of my close colleagues actually was a professor who was a dear mentor to me said look the way you need to think about a talk is like inviting somebody to your house and when they come to your house they don't know what's inside it.

      "transcript": "There's two ways to see the world. Some people see the thing that they want, and some people see the thing that prevents them from getting the thing that they want. There's a great story of two lumberjacks where every morning they start chopping wood at the same time, and every day they stop chopping wood at the same time. And every day, one of the lumberjacks disappears for about an hour in the middle of the day, and every day he chops more wood than the other guy. And this goes on for months. And eventually, the one who works all day, he says, I don't understand. Every day we start at the same time. Every day we stop at the same time. Every day you disappear for about an hour in the middle of the day, and every day you chop more wood than me. Where do you go for that hour? And the other lumberjack looks up and goes, oh, go home and sharpen my axe. You know, if you take an infinite mindset, it's not about how much you can get done each day. It's how much you can get done over the course of a career or over the course of a lifetime. And you've got to take vacations, which means you turn on the lights, and you turn off your email, and you turn off your phone, and you do not connect to the office. You know, go sharpen your axe. I have five little rules that you can follow as you find your spark and bring your spark to life. The first is to go after the things that you want. Let me tell you a story. So a friend of mine and I, we went for a run in Central Park. The Roadrunners organization, on the weekends, they host races. And it's very common at the end of the race, they'll have a sponsor who will give away something. Apple. They'll give away bagels or bagels or something. And on this particular day, when we got to the end of the run, there were some free bagels. And they had picnic tables set up. And on one side was a group of volunteers. On the table were boxes of bagels. And on the other side was a long line of runners waiting to get their free bagel. So I said to my friend, let's get a bagel. And he looked at me and said, ah, the line's too long. And I said, free bagel. And he said, I don't want to wait in line. And I was like, free bagel. And he says, nah, it's too long. And that's when I realized that there's two ways to see the world. Some people see the thing that they want. And some people see the thing that prevents them from getting the thing that they want. I could only see the bagels. He could only see the line. And so I walked up to the line. I leaned in between two people. Put my hand in the box and pulled out two bagels. And no one got mad at me. Because the rule is, you can go after whatever you want. You just cannot deny anyone else to go after whatever they want. So the point is, is you don't have to wait in line. You don't have to do it the way everybody else has done it. You can do it your way. You can break the rules. You just can't get in the way of somebody else getting what they want. Rule number two.",

We live in a world that is exquisitely dependent on science and technology, but where anyone knows hardly anything about science and technology. So this is a problem, and this is what I'm going to talk to you about today. It's about science communication, a field that is relatively new in Malaysia and in developing countries, and the importance of communicating science. Have a look at these images. New technologies, emerging technologies, and the unknowns create fear among the public. Technologies like genetically modified...",

Greetings, thanks, and congratulations to Kenyon's graduating class of 2005. There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says, Morning, boys. How's the water? And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, What the hell is water? This is a standard requirement of U.S. commencement speeches, the deployment of didactic little parable-ish stories. The story thing turns out to be one of the better, less bullshitty conventions of the genre. But if you're worried that I plan to present myself here as the wise older fish explaining what water is to you younger fish, please don't be. I am not the wise old fish. The point of the fish story is merely that the most obvious, important realities are often the ones that are hardest to see. and talk about. Stated as an English sentence, of course, this is just a banal platitude. But the fact is that in the day-to-day trenches of adult existence, banal platitudes can have a life-or-death importance. Or so I wish to suggest to you on this dry and lovely morning. Of course, the main requirement of speeches like this is that I'm supposed to talk about your liberal arts education's meaning, to try to explain why the degree you're about to receive has actual human value instead of just a materialistic, material payoff. So let's talk about the single most pervasive clich\u00e9 in the commencement speech genre, which is that a liberal arts education is not so much about filling you up with knowledge as it is about, quote, teaching you how to think. If you're like me as a student, you've never liked hearing this, and you tend to feel a bit insulted by the claim that you've needed anybody to teach you how to think, since the fact that you even got admitted to a college this good seems like proof that you already know how to think. But I'm going to posit to you that the liberal arts education, the liberal arts clich\u00e9, turns out not to be insulting at all, because the really significant education in thinking that we're supposed to get in a place like this isn't really about the capacity to think, but rather about the choice of what to think about. If your total freedom of choice regarding what to think about seems too obvious to waste time discussing, I'd ask you to think about fish and water, and to bracket for just a few minutes your skepticism about the value of the totally obvious. Here's another didactic little story. There are these two guys sitting together in a bar in the remote Alaskan wilderness. One of the guys is religious, the other's an atheist, and the two are arguing about the existence of God with that special intensity that comes after about the fourth beer. And the atheist says, look, it's not like I don't have actual religion,",

      "transcript": "Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure. Like success is getting what you want. Fulfillment is living what you're made for. Fulfillment and success, they're not even the same universe. People ask me all the time, what does it take to be happy? And I always tell them, it's really simple. One word, progress. Progress equals happiness. If you keep growing, you're gonna feel alive. And if you keep growing, you're gonna have more to give. It doesn't matter how many statues, Oscars they give you, or Emmys, or how much money you have in the bank. We've all seen people have all those things and I get the phone call because they're depressed or somebody commits suicide in that area. It's really an inner game, and I think that's what's missing for us today. Everybody's focusing on the outside world and hell, there's a lot of things in the outside world you'll never be able to control. You can influence, but you can't control it. This, your mind, your emotions, your body, you have 100% control over what you do with these things and that's where the game is won. Win the inner game, then you win the outer game. But a lot of people spent their life trying to win the outer game, they won and they're miserable. Someone can tell you your whole life you're a piece of crap and you can say, screw you, read between the lines, and make your life work. Someone can tell you your whole life you're beautiful, you're intelligent, you're the smartest person in the world, and you don't believe it. Because self-esteem doesn't come from what people say about you. Self-esteem is earned within yourself. It's esteem for yourself which only comes by doing things that are incredibly difficult, and then you can do it. Self-esteem is earned within yourself. It's esteem for yourself which only comes by doing things that are incredibly difficult, and then you can do it. And then your brain goes, this is who I am. You really gotta figure out what you're made for, and nobody knows in the beginning. So you start where you are and you do what's in front of you, do what's next, and you keep growing until you start to discover, hey, this is my real passion. So identity is the number one thing I work to change with people, to expand it. Expand your own sense of who you really are and what you're capable of. And the mindset has to be destroy any limitation and move forward, move forward, move forward. I think passion is the genesis. I think passion is the genesis. The genesis of genius. If you've got enough passion, you're gonna find answers nobody else does. But most people run out of fuel, meaning they get tired, they get exhausted, they get burned out, they get the law of familiarity. They're around something so much, they take it a little bit for granted. And I've managed to see something in myself that I found in every great leader that I've ever respected, and that is I value intelligence immensely, but I know really smart people can't fight their way out of a paper bag. But pragmatically right? What I see is the one common denominator people that are successful over a lifetime is the sustained hunger, hunger is the number one factor. You need to be good at pattern recognition and that's an all in all,",

I am the son of parents of modest formal education and the product of fairly modest schooling myself. But here I stand before all of you who have dedicated your lives to scholarship. And I do wonder what, if any, words of wisdom I might offer other than perhaps to try to make sense of our current moment in history. With that in mind, let me begin with a slight rephrasing of Shakespeare. Friends, countrymen, scientists of the world, lend me your ears. For the next 25 minutes or so, I want to speak to you from my head and my heart. Speak to you about the possibility. The possibility of a new age of reason. This is in the spirit of, in an amended quote from Tennyson, Ours is not just to live and die. Ours is to reason why. I've seen a lot over the course of my lifetime. A result of my age and of my chosen career as a journalist. I've covered maybe too many individual stories to count. Some, like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the terror attacks. Of 9-11 are seared in my memory. But increasingly, I'm struck by the broader themes that I have witnessed. The lines and curves that emerge when you plot individual story points along the axis of history. The struggle for civil rights, the digital revolution, a burgeoning environmental movement, and so many more. As these waves of change lap upon us. It's not always clear where we are heading or what will the next tide bring. We need to prepare ourselves for an unpredictable future. By sorting out facts from the noise. By challenging our own biases and preconceptions. By celebrating the most best and creative instincts of the human mind. And by expanding the knowledge upon which we make decisions. Thankfully, as a speaker, I'm not alone. As a species, we have created a marvelous framework to organize our energies towards such worthy goals. It's called science. I believe science represents a pinnacle of human achievement, like art, music, and literature.",

      "transcript": "The easiest way to tell you what a workshop is, is to tell you what a workshop isn't. And what a workshop isn't is essentially this. This is a meeting. This is where most employees spend their time at work. It's meeting other people in the company. It's groups of people coming together, whether it's in person or whether it's on Zoom. And usually they come together to solve problems, to make decisions, to catch up. And usually these meetings sort of go like this. And it just keeps going around and round and round and round and round. And usually what happens at the end of the meeting? What's the end outcome of a meeting? Well, it's somebody saying, hey, let's set up another meeting because of this meeting. So meetings tend to spawn other meetings. And that's exactly not what a workshop is. Meetings don't often have clear outcomes. Meetings often don't have clear agendas. And meetings are also not facilitated. Meetings are a group of people coming together, talking and trying to figure things out. And what we found at AJNC... What's smart and at WorkShopper is if you really need to make decisions in a group or really need to solve problems in a group, then meetings don't really work. And that's where workshops come in. Workshops are a step-by-step, systematized session that allow groups of people to make decisions and solve problems. They're facilitated by one person who brings people through these individual exercises, which are usually chosen by the facilitator. Or the WorkShopper, as we call it here. And these sessions always have a clear decision at the end or clear problem solved at the end and clear next steps and don't always necessarily spawn more and more and more meetings. If you're just trying to get together with a team and you just want to chat and it's just about catching up or whatever, and you do not need to make decisions, then a workshop is overkill. You don't need a workshop. But if you need to bring a group of people together, make decisions, solve problems, actually get things done. Actually get things done. That are important to the business, then it's always better to have a facilitated session and a facilitated session like this is what we would call a workshop. Now workshop doesn't have to be an elaborate, huge multi-day session that has like post-its everywhere and it's like really deep and takes weeks to plan. As you can see in our other videos, we've got this video up here, how to run a workshop in 15 minutes. You don't need to run long workshops. A workshop can be 15 minutes. It can be an hour. It can fit into whatever normal session you were going to do. Anyway, it doesn't have to be something that's completely changing the entire business. That's also why we're not such huge fans of forcing companies into doing things like design thinking where they have to have these huge robust systems for getting things done. Running workshops should be almost improv. You know, you could be in a meeting and realize this happens all the time at AJ and Smart. You're in a meeting, you realize it's not going anywhere and then someone says, Hey, can I facilitate?",

As a reminder, this session will be recorded, so if everyone will go ahead and turn off their microphones and cameras, it will be beneficial. If you have any questions, please post those in the chat. Before we begin, I wanted to thank everyone for your time last month to discuss everything artificial intelligence, from the range of fascinating possibilities to the potential challenges ahead and how best to limit your liability. Since this webinar covers April's educational topic, I'll give everybody a sneak peek into the topics we'll cover when we meet in May. As many of you know, our focus this year is on management training. We've recently implemented collaborative management meetings, basically a 15-minute meeting once per quarter to promote internal communication, as well as to provide a forum for managers to proactively share any current or looming concerns. We've had great success with the program so far and are eager to bring the benefits to more of you. We'll also discuss our focus trainings, such as discipline and discharge and harassment prevention. Now for our main event, I'd like to introduce Keith Hammond from the Hammond Law Center. As many of you know, we partner with Keith to answer many of your employment-related questions, and at least once a year, we work with Keith to provide overall employment law updates. So without further ado, Keith, I'll turn it over to you. Great. Thank you so much, Myra. And I'd just like to start by thanking Myra and everybody at AAG. We've been doing these updates for many years now, and previously we held these in person. We've done them online for the last several years. It has worked out well. I will say that the one thing I do miss about in-person presentations is that we tend not to get as many questions when we're online. If you would like to ask a question, please feel free at any time. There is a comment box or a chat box in the upper right corner of your screen where you can type in a message, and I will talk to you about that. Thank you so much. Well, welcome, everybody. Let me just dive right into it. You know, the reason that we're here today, every year, is to go over",

      "transcript": "Do you know the secret to successfully pitching an idea? Well, it's something kind of unexpected. It's FOMO, the fear of missing out. As someone who invests in companies early in their journeys, I listen to nearly 2,000 pitches a year, and I work countless hours with company founders to help them make their pitch even more compelling. You may equate pitching with a slick deck based on some standard format, but whether you're pitching a company or trying to get buy-in for a passion project at work, so much of pitching is a storytelling exercise. You need to bring people along with you. You need to tell your audience a story that not only will draw them in, but it will make them feel that if they don't say yes, they will be missing out on something really big. When people think about pitching, they're thinking inwards. They think about their nerves, how smoothly they're talking, or what it takes to get there. But the secret of successful pitching is to flip it outward. Who are you pitching to? What do they care about? How can you speak to what motivates them? For example, if you're pitching your startup idea to a venture capitalist who has lots of money to invest and needs big returns, they probably care about backing the next Uber or DoorDash. So you should focus your story on the size of the market opportunity. If you're pitching to a philanthropist or a nonprofit, their motivation is likely about large social impact. So focus on showing how your product or idea will improve things in a lasting way. If you're pitching a project at work, focus on the people you're pitching the project to. What do they care about? More customer loyalty, more revenue, or perhaps a promotion? Tell them how your project will help them attain the goal that they want in a way that makes it almost inevitable. Give them that feeling of, if I don't support this, I'm going to miss out on something I care about deeply. Pitching is much like telling a story, just like a movie tells a story. You're charting the hero's journey in three acts. First, you start by telling about the hero's world, the status quo. In this case, the current situation that your product, idea, or service will be addressing. Then, introduce tension and conflict, showing all the problems, that existing products aren't yet addressing. This will lead you to the big confrontation. You, the hero, sweeping in to save the day. And from there, give the resolution. How are things changed as a result of your actions? How does your product, idea, or service solve the problems you highlighted earlier? One of the best pitches I've heard followed this arc perfectly. The story started with a disturbing status quo.",

      "transcript": "When I was 27 years old, I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding, teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher, I made quizzes and tests, I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back, I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking, the kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math, sure they're hard, ratios, decimals, the area of a parallelogram, but these concepts are not impossible. And I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching, I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective, from a psychological perspective. In education, the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily? So I left the classroom and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings. And in every study, my question was, who is successful here and why? My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. I was a student there. I was a student there. I went to the University of Prairie placard in West Point aztra. I was a Junior in their class. I was a senior when they were willing to teach middle school and then graduated middle school. I grabbed my finished untuk officers who could learn so well, but left them to prepare them for whatever society they faced. We tried to study which cadets could do better, whichAAAA who couldn't. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee study in North Kai land international-spelling v where we tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We learned as a rookie teacher working in really tough neighborhoods, asking which teachers who would stay in teaching by the end of school year, and who would be the most effective in improving learning. with private companies asking which of these sales people is going to keep their jobs and who's going to earn the most money in all those very different contexts one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success and it wasn't social intelligence it wasn't good looks physical health and it wasn't iq it was",

And in so doing, I'm going to give you the skill necessary to become a world-class artist. And it shouldn't take more than about 15 seconds. But before I do that, how many of you believe you could replicate this image of a solid gray square? Every one of us. And if you can make one gray square, you can make two, three, nine. Truth of the matter is, if you could make just one gray square, it'd be very difficult to argue that you couldn't make every gray square necessary to replicate the image in its entirety. And there you have it. I've just given you the skill necessary to become a world-class artist. I know what you're thinking. That's not real art. It certainly wouldn't make me a world-class artist. So let me introduce you. Chuck Close is one of the highest-earning artists in the entire world for decades. And he creates his art using this exact technique. You see, what stands between us and achieving even our most ambitious dreams has far less to do with possessing some magical skill or talent and far more to do with how we approach problems and make decisions to solve them. And because of the continuous and compounding nature of all those millions of decisions that we face on a regular basis. Even a marginal improvement in our process can have a huge impact on our end results. And I'll prove this to you by taking a look at the career of Novak Djokovic. Back in 2004, when he first became a professional tennis player, he was ranked 680th in the world. It wasn't until the end of his third year that he jumped up to be ranked third in the world. He went from making $250,000 a year to $5 million a year in prize money alone. And of course, he did that. But he also went from making $250,000 a year to $5 million a year in prize money alone. And of course, he did this by winning more matches. In 2011, he became the number one ranked men's tennis player in the world, started earning an average of $14 million a year in prize money alone, and winning and dominating 90% of his matches. Now, here's what's really interesting about all of these very impressive statistics. Novak doesn't control any of them. What he does control are all the tiny little decisions that he needs to make correctly along the way in order to move the... To move the probability in favor of him achieving these types of results. And we can quantify and track his progress in this area by taking a look at the percentage of points that he wins. Because in tennis, the typical point involves one to maybe three decisions. I like to refer to this as his decision success rate. So back when he was winning about...",

      "transcript": "There are two things that I think that great leaders need to have. Empathy and perspective. And I think these things are very often forgotten. Leaders are so often so concerned about their status or their position in an organization they actually forget their real job. And the real job of a leader is not about being in charge, it's about taking care of those in our charge. And I don't think people realize this and I don't think people train for this. When we're junior our only responsibility is to be good at our jobs. That's all we really have to do. And some people actually go get advanced educations so that they can be really good at their jobs, accountants or whatever, right? And you show up and you work hard and the company will give us tons and tons of training how to do our jobs. It all shows how to use the software, they'll send us away for a few days to get trained in whatever it is that we're doing for the company. And then they expect us to go be good at our jobs. And that's what we do. We work very hard. And if you're good at your job, they'll promote you. And at some point you'll get promoted to position where we're now responsible for the people who do the job we used to do, but nobody shows us how to do that. And that's why we get managers and not leaders. Because the reason our managers are micromanaging us is because they actually do know how to do the job better than us. That's what got them promoted. Really what we have to do is go through a transition. Some people make it quickly, some people make it slowly, and unfortunately some people will never make that transition at all. Which is we have to go through this transition of being responsible for the job and then turning it to somebody who's now responsible for the people who are responsible for the job. And as I said before, one of the great things that is lacking in most of our companies is that they are not teaching us how to lead. And leadership is a skill like any other, is a practicable, learnable skill. And it is something that you work on. It's like a muscle. If you practice it all the days, you will get good at it and you will become a strong leader. If you stop practicing, you will become a weak leader. Like parenting, everyone has the capacity to be a parent. Doesn't mean everybody wants to be a parent, and doesn't mean everybody should be a parent. Leadership is the same. We all have the capacity to be a leader. Doesn't mean everybody should be a leader, and it doesn't mean everybody wants to be a leader. And the reason is because it comes at great personal sacrifice. Remember, you're not in charge, you're responsible for those in your charge. That means things like when everything goes right, you have to give away all the credit. And when everything goes wrong, you have to take all the responsibility. That sucks, right? It's things like staying late to show somebody what to do. It's things like when something does actually break, when something goes wrong, instead of yelling and screaming and taking over, you say hey.",

      "transcript": "Leadership is perhaps one of the most misunderstood subjects in business. Leadership has nothing to do with rank. I know many people who sit at the highest levels of an organization who are not leaders. We do as they tell us because they have authority over us, but we do not trust them and we do not follow them. I also know people at low levels of organizations that have no formal authority, but they've made a choice. The choice to look after the person to the left of them, the choice to look after the person to the right of them, and we would trust them and follow them anywhere. Leadership is the awesome responsibility to see those around us rise. You, every one of us, can choose to be the leader we wish we had. We lead our teams and we can lead our clients when we decide to be the leader. We decide that we will do everything in our power to see them rise, to see them achieve their ambitions and their dreams. And this is what servant leadership means. I serve your dream rather than you serve my bottom line. And it's totally fine to have financial goals. It's totally fine to have metrics because that becomes the proof of value that somebody wants to give you their money because they believe in you. It is proof positive. But the best leaders I know are students of leadership. There's no such thing as an expert leader. It doesn't exist. Like there's no such thing as an expert parent. It doesn't exist. Right? We are students of leadership. And even the most senior leaders constantly are reading books, reading articles, watching talks, having conversations all the time about leadership. They're always in learning mode. And I think for anyone who wants to be a leader, you have to choose to be a student of the subject, like anything. If you want to be good at something, you have to study it. And the most ignored characteristic of leadership, you know, we talk about vision and charisma. Yes, these are important. But I have known some wonderful leaders who don't have huge world changing vision. I've known some wonderful leaders that are quiet and sit in the corner, but they all have courage. The courage to advance a vision, the courage to ignore the short term ups and downs of the business, the courage to take risks on people, the courage to believe in people, the courage to speak truth to power, the courage to do the right thing and have integrity. I think courage is a very undervalued characteristic of leadership.",

      "transcript": "Thank you, Elder President Oaks. That was a beautiful reminder of the words of our Lord, whom we all love. As we remember this weekend, the Savior's triumphal entry into Jerusalem shortly before His atoning sacrifice, I recall His words of hope and comfort. I am the resurrection and the life. He that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. I love Him. I believe Him. I testify that He is the resurrection and the life. This testimony has comforted and strengthened me during the past four and a half years since my wife Barbara passed away. I miss her. Often. I have been reflecting on our eternal marriage and our life together. I previously have shared how I first met Barbara and how that experience taught me to use the skill of following up that I learned on my mission. I had to follow up quickly with her after I first met her. She was beautiful, popular, and had a very busy soul. I was always busy, but she was always a part of my social calendar. I was smitten early because she was approachable and friendly. I admired her goodness. I felt that she and I belong together. It seemed simple in my mind. Barbara and I dated, and our relationship began to grow, but she was uncertain that marriage to me was the right for her. It wasn't enough for me to know. But Barbara needed to know for herself. I knew if we spent time fasting and praying about the matter, Barbara could receive a confirmation from Heaven. We spent a weekend without dating so we could fast and pray individually to know for ourselves. Fortunately for me, she received the same confirmation that I did. The rest, as they say, is history. When Barbara passed away, our children put on her headstone several lessons that Barbara wanted them to remember. One of those lessons is, what matters most is what lasts longest. Today I will share from my heart a few feelings",

      "transcript": "Most people who come to speak at TED are here because they've succeeded. I'm here because I haven't. For the last 10 years, I have been helping conference speakers, business leaders, entrepreneurs to prepare and deliver powerful presentations. And in those same 10 years, TED has shown that presentations can and should be both enjoyable and effective. But 10 years on, despite TED and despite my best efforts at schools, at conferences, at companies, most presentations still do this to their audiences. So have I failed? No, I just haven't succeeded yet. And to succeed in making all presentations resonate with their audience, I need your help. That's why I'm here. So I'd like to share with you the three magic ingredients of powerful presentations. Okay, let's just pause there for a moment. Now, I've told you what I'm going to say. The question you should be asking is, so what? What's in it for me? Why should I care? And that is a really important question because the first magic ingredient is, in fact, the audience. The audience is the magic ingredient in every presentation. This is not my talk, it's yours. Every presentation should be made to measure for a specific audience in a specific context. So why should you care about the magic ingredients of great presentations? Well, it's very important, right? It's really important to understand that we all have to listen to presentations. Wouldn't it be great if they weren't all so boring? But we don't just listen to presentations. We also have to give presentations, right? How many of you ever have to give presentations? I think if we're honest, we all do. Sooner or later, at school, at work, and also in interviews, we all have to present with or without slides. And it's how well we present that will make a huge difference to how well we succeed. That's why you should care. So that's the first magic ingredient. The audience. Always make it special for them. The second magic ingredient is the speaker. Now, okay, you're probably looking at me and thinking, well, Phil, not very magical. Thanks, by the way. But it's really important.",

I'm delighted to welcome you to our quarterly business review. Thank you, Mr. Tom. We're eager to hear about the company's performance and future strategies. Excellent. Let's kick things off by examining our financial results for the past quarter. Could you elaborate on how these figures compare to our projections from last year? Certainly. As you can see from this graph, we've exceeded our revenue targets by 15%. That's impressive. What factors contributed to this success? Our new product line and expanded market presence were key drivers of this growth. Interesting. How do you foresee these trends impacting our long-term goals? We believe this momentum will significantly accelerate our five-year plan. That's encouraging news. What challenges do you see in the future? What challenges do you anticipate as we move forward? One potential hurdle is the increasing competition in our primary markets. Have we developed any strategies to address this competitive pressure? Indeed, we're focusing on innovation and customer retention to maintain our edge. Could you provide more details about our customer retention initiatives? We're implementing a new loyalty program and enhancing our customer service capabilities. How will these initiatives be implemented in terms of success? We'll be tracking customer satisfaction scores and repeat purchase rates closely. That sounds comprehensive. Are there any new markets we're considering entering? Yes. We're exploring opportunities in emerging markets in Southeast Asia. Fascinating. What research has been done to support this expansion? Our market analysis team has conducted extensive studies on consumer behavior and economic trends in the region. Let's listen again. Good morning, everyone.

      "transcript": "We live in a world in which people seem to be screaming at each other. Climate change is real, climate change is not real, vaccines work, they're safe, they're not safe. What's interesting about all the screaming is that everybody seems to really believe that science is on their side, that the other side of the argument has somehow been duped. So where does that leave us? How do those of us that are involved with science communication make a difference? How do we add value? Stick with me, I've got a framework that you might find useful. Let's think about the voices in any of these conversations as existing on a matrix that represents their relative level of education, training, experience, expertise, let's call that qualifications in an area, against their relative level of objectivity on that subject. And we can imagine four quadrants. And we're going to go through each of these quadrants, and I'm going to focus on the one on the top left. Now the top left quadrant, this is the quadrant in which I find myself on most subjects. And believe it or not, acknowledging that fact represents a really powerful communications opportunity. And I'm going to get to that in just a minute. Now who sits in these quadrants? Let's start at the bottom on the left. Here we've got the ideologues. These are people who take a position on a subject because of some pre-existing ideology. It could be their religion, it could be their political affiliation. Look, we're all very tribal, and we're all predisposed to adopting beliefs that are held by a group of people from whom we'd like acceptance. So no judgment here, on some issue or another, we all probably fall into this. Two things about this quadrant. Firstly, you're not going to change people's minds. So don't get emotionally involved with some debate that you can't win. People in this quadrant never know that they're in this quadrant. And when we are in this quadrant, we're subject to a few things. Firstly, motivated reasoning. We start with an idea, and then we look for a narrative that supports it. And part of that includes something called confirmation bias. We pay much, much more attention to information that supports the belief or idea that we want. And lastly, we're not going to to information that doesn't. We all do this from time to time. We also see what's called the Dunning-Kruger effect. And basically, this means that the less competent a person is in an area, the more likely they are to overestimate their own competency in that area. Politicians do this all the time. Now, let's look at the next quadrant. Here, we've got a category of people or groups or institutions who, despite having a high level of expertise, are still nevertheless not objective. So a good example of this is industry or industry funding. funded research or ideologically funded research, where financial or ideological incentives come into play. You might find that only those studies that support a particular position get submitted for publication, or that the science itself is subject to something we call p-hacking. Now p-hacking is a process whereby researchers deliberately or sometimes even unconsciously make a small number of decisions, but in sequence, along the research process path that biases the results in a particular direction. Now research coming from industry, for example, can be considered more",
