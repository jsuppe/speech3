And there's a boat, just floating, not moving or anything. Trees are on the sides. Some birds up there, flying. Looks peaceful. It's… um… nice, I think. Yeah, real nice. I like the colors. It's, uh, a really good picture, I guess."

transcript_lowmid = "Okay, so in this picture, I see a sunset over a really calm lake. The sun is big and orange, and the sky has some pink and yellow. The water looks smooth, and there's a small boat floating. Trees are on both sides, kinda dark. Some birds are flying above. Everything looks peaceful, like maybe it's evening and getting dark. The colors are really pretty. It kinda makes me feel relaxed, like just sitting there."

transcript_mid = "This picture shows a beautiful sunset over a quiet lake. The sun is low, casting golden light across the water, which looks really smooth. A small boat floats there, empty, just drifting. Trees on either side make the scene feel enclosed, cozy. Birds fly in the distance, adding movement. Everything about it feels peaceful, like the end of a long day. It reminds me of times when I've just sat and watched the sunset."

transcript_highmid = "The image depicts a stunning sunset over a still lake, with golden hues reflecting across the water's surface. A solitary boat drifts gently, giving a sense of quiet solitude. Surrounding trees frame the composition, their dark silhouettes contrasting against the glowing sky. Birds in flight add a subtle dynamic element. The scene conveys tranquility and introspection, almost like a moment suspended in time. It's the kind of place where someone might sit and reflect."

transcript_high = "This image masterfully captures a moment of quiet beauty—a golden sunset dissolving into the lake's mirrored surface. The unoccupied boat, adrift, suggests solitude, even longing. Trees frame the scene, their darkened forms grounding the composition. Birds in flight add energy, a fleeting contrast to the lake's stillness. Light and shadow interact gracefully, creating depth and warmth. It's a study in balance, stillness, and impermanence, evoking both peace and a touch of melancholy."
