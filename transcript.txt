I'm staring out the window blankly. I'm quite, I'm warm. I'm thinking of summer time and smells of outside as school is coming to pass. I smell the green of the trees and freshness of hte breeze. I see a tree outside the window, and I'm staring at it. I see the trunk in my vision, and then in my periphery as I slowly start looking away. There is a spot where if I keep looking at the tree, I see hte trunk disappear and in my peripheral vision is just the top of the tree. It doesn't look weird, because I can't really see it when I'm not looking right at it.
